Laptop Price Predictor

Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts laptop prices based on various features. The primary goal is to explore and understand how different specifications (such as RAM, processor type, and screen size) influence the pricing of laptops.

Features
Data Cleaning: The dataset was processed to remove missing or erroneous values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and summaries to identify trends and correlations between features.
Model Training: Several machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, etc.) were tested to identify the best model.
Model Evaluation: The performance of models was evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R² score.
Notebooks
laptop-price-predictor.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook contains the entire process from data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
Requirements
The following libraries are used in this project:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Importing the dataset and handling missing data.
Feature scaling and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing distributions and relationships between variables.
Correlation heatmaps to identify key features.
Model Selection:

Training multiple machine learning models.
Cross-validation for reliable performance estimation.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the models based on the error metrics and selecting the best-performing one.
Results
The best-performing model for laptop price prediction was found to be Model XYZ, with the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): X
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Y
R² Score: Z
Future Work
Improve model accuracy by hyperparameter tuning.
Explore additional features, such as brand perception and warranty periods, to further enhance predictions.
Deploy the model as a web service using Flask or FastAPI.
